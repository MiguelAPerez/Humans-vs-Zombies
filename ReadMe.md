# Humans vs Zombies


### Team
 * **Miguel**: Building a vehicle to hold the project components.
 * **Dustin**: Building a nerf cannon that will angle up/down and rotate side to side. 
 * **Faizan**: Creating the object detection mechanism to target objects.

### Goal
 We plan to create a vehicle which shoots nerf projectiles for the campus wide game called ‘Humans vs. Zombie’. Our tank has two hardware modules, the tanks enclosure and the nerf cannon used to fire the nerf pelts. We hope to add object recognition to our project to make it autonomous We will not only be using the Pi’s onboard GPIO pins but use a server to stream any video information onto a web-server. The Pi will also log anyone it dems to be a threatening for correction or algorithm calibration.
