# This directory has all the 3d models created and used for the project.
| 3D File | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| [RightArm.stl](RightArm.stl) | The right arm for the nerf gun stand which the stepper motor and gears will attach to the right bracket of the nerf gun so the nerf gun can rotate. |
| [LeftArm.stl](LeftArm.stl) | The Left arm for the nerf gun stand which will only act as a support for holding the nerf gun. |
| [BracketAxle.stl](BracketAxle.stl) | Each axle goes in the bearing on each arm to connect the stands to the brackets. |
| [LargeGear.stl](LargeGear.stl) | This gear will go on the right axle, between the bracket and the bearing. |
| [SmallGear.stl](SmallGear.stl) | This gear will go on the stepper motor. |
## Extra Notes
##### -All 3D files were printed using a Prusa i3 MK3 with the settings in Prusa Control of Detail: 0.1mm and Infill: 50%
##### -Some sanding of parts will be required for them to fit together properly \*\*becareful not to shave too much off since they must fit snuggly\*\*
