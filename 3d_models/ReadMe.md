# This directory has all the 3d models created and used for the project.
| 3D File | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| [Arm.stl](Arm.stl) | The support arm (without a motor mount), will act as a support to help keep the nerf gun level with a bearing hole that fits an axle. |
| [ArmAxle.stl](ArmAxle.stl) | The axle connects the stands to the nerf gun mounting brackets (or laser mounting bracket), so they can rotate freely in a bearing. |
| [ArmAxleGear.stl](ArmAxleGear.stl) | This gear fits on the arm axle to mesh with the steppergear. |
| [ArmStand.stl](ArmStand.stl) | This stand has two sides that clamp the arms to hold them in place and connect them to the top. |
| [ArmStandMount.stl](ArmStandMount.stl) | This mount has holes and goes on the underside of the top for the arm stands to screw in. |
| [ArmStepper.stl](ArmStepper.stl) | The stepper arm for the nerf gun stand has a mount for the stepper motor (which will have a gear) and a hole for the axle bearing and the axle (which will also have a gear) to attach to the bracket of the nerf gun (or laser pointer) so the cannon can rotate. |
| [ArmStepperGear.stl](ArmStepperGear.stl) | This gear will slide on to the stepper motor and mesh with the axle gear to rotate the cannon. |
| [Base.stl](Base.stl) | The base will have the top slid on to rotate in the track. |
| [BaseGear.stl](BaseGear.stl) | This gear will be slid on the center pole to mesh with the servo gear. |
| [LaserMount.stl](LaserMount.stl) | The laser pointer will be connected to this mount. |
| [LaserMountBracket.stl](LaserMountBracket.stl) | The laser pointer mount will connect to this bracket which will connect to the arm axle. |
| [ServoGear.stl](ServoGear.stl) | This gear will be put on the servo horn and mesh with the base gear to rotate the top. |
| [ServoMount.stl](ServoMount.stl) | This mount goes on the top of the top and will have the servo screwed in. |
| [Top.stl](Top.stl) | The top will have the servo and arms mounted on it and then will be mounted to the base. |
| [TopBearingWasher.stl](TopBearingWasher.stl) | The washer will go between the center bearing in the top and the screw that will screw in to the base. |

## Extra Notes
##### - All 3D files were printed using a Standard Prusa i3 MK3 with the settings in Prusa Control of Detail: 0.1mm and Infill: around 20%
##### - Some sanding of parts will be required for them to fit together properly \*\*becareful not to remove too much material. They must fit snuggly\*\*
